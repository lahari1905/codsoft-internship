## üöÄ TASK 1 - Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective:**  
Build a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Description:**  
Utilized a dataset containing anonymized features of credit card transactions to identify fraud. Applied preprocessing techniques to handle class imbalance and experimented with various models to maximize accuracy and precision.

**Techniques & Algorithms Used:**  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forests  
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for balancing classes

## üé¨ TASK 2 - Movie Genre Classification

**Objective:**  
Create a machine learning model to predict a movie's genre based on its plot summary.

**Description:**  
Analyzed movie plot summaries using Natural Language Processing techniques to classify them into genres. Focused on feature extraction from textual data using vectorization methods and trained classifiers to predict genres.

**Techniques & Algorithms Used:**  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## üìâ TASK 3 - Customer Churn Prediction

**Objective:**  
Develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to cancel their subscription.

**Description:**  
Used historical data on customer behavior and demographics to train models that predict churn. Emphasis was placed on feature selection, handling missing data, and tuning models for better performance.

**Techniques & Algorithms Used:**  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forests  
- Gradient Boosting  
- Feature Engineering & Correlation Analysis
